Study Connection

The goal of our app is to facilitate social connectedness among students at Chapman. The vertical prototype that I completed for our app highlights the functionality of the calendar feature. The vertical slice allows students to schedule study groups or other events on their calendar. In Human-Computer Interaction, the goal is to make technologies intuitive and user-friendly, so my prototype also includes a speech-to-text option. This makes the app multi-modal so that it is accessible. This is important because making applications multi-modal helps improve the user-experience for everyone regardless of their abilities.
